# Tensorflow Studies

## Purpose

These scripts are fragments from experimentation and tutorials.

Some of the places I've been checking out ...
* https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification
* https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification
* https://medium.mybridge.co/30-amazing-machine-learning-projects-for-the-past-year-v-2018-b853b8621ac7
* https://www.hackster.io/tensorflow/projects
* https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow

I have hopes to use this along with numpy for my rpg code which is numerically heavy.
